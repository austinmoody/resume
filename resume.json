Self starter with an intricate understanding of how various systems interact in the healthcare setting. I love being handed two disparate systems who do not want to speak and making them do so whether using an interface engine, custom code, or a combination of both. Finding the most efficient and effective solution and implementing it in a way that makes everyone smile is what makes me tick.",
